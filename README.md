<h1> Rental-Insight</h1>  
  As demand for rental housing increases, there is a need for better tools to help simplify the search 
process. Current web­based solutions only offer standard information focused on the rental unit itself such 
as rent, location, bedroom capacity, bathroom capacity, and a brief description. Although these 
information are important, they do not provide a complete picture of a rental unit, which may lead to 
ill-informed decision making. Rental­Insight is a hybrid mobile application that offer users a 
neighborhood profile in addition to standard information about a rental unit. This neighborhood profile 
include information about local crimes, nearby grocery stores and schools. Users could also survey a 
neighborhood without being there physically. Rental­Insight is a proof­of­concept that a neighborhood 
profile along with standard information can help renters make better decisions when searching for rental 
housing.
